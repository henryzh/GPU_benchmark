DRAM Timing Options:
nbk                                    16 # number of banks
CCD                                     2 # column to column delay
RRD                                     6 # minimal delay between activation of rows in different banks
RCD                                    12 # row to column delay
RAS                                    28 # time needed to activate row
RP                                     12 # time needed to precharge (deactivate) row
RC                                     40 # row cycle time
CDLR                                    5 # switching from write to read (changes tWTR)
WR                                     12 # last data-in to row precharge
CL                                     12 # CAS latency
WL                                      4 # Write latency
nbkgrp                                  4 # number of bank groups
CCDL                                    3 # column to column delay between accesses to different bank groups
RTPL                                    2 # read to precharge delay between accesses to different bank groups
